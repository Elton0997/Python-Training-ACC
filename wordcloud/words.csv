Iâ€™m

Great

to

Looking

"Why

a

participation

certificate

?

what

was

the

answer?"
"Hi

!

I

am

Akanksha

from

Bengaluru."
"Can

we

all

write

to

Eruditus

for

the

same?"
"Yes

we

may

!!"
Yes
"Like

asking

them

to

consider

giving

us

a

completion

certificate"
"Hey

everyone!

Is

next

session

also

orientation

or

teaching

will

take

place?

Did

he

answer

that?"
"Yes

makes

sense.

We

should

all

write

on

the

email

if"
"hi

every

one"
Id*
"Next

session

is

like

an

academic

orientation."
"I

think

its

because

there

is

no

final

exam

/grades

to

be

given

at

end

of

course

deciding

if

you

cleared

it"
"I

had

raised

this

question

prior

the

didnâ€™t

get

a

satisfactory

answer"
"If

itâ€™s

orientation

with

the

faculty

we

can

raise

it

"But

still

doesn't

make

sense...after

paying

such

high

fees"
"I

understand,

but

I

still

think

we

should

try

our

best

to

make

it

completion

as

giving

an

exam

after

6months

isn't

a

very

difficult

thing."

everyone

,"
"Thatâ€™s

right.

The

only

parameter

they

checking

is

Attendance."

may

is

are

discussing

about

the

going

we

a

from

IITb

???"

from

participation

why

you..

good

observation"

the

tangible

benefit/difference

of

think

it's

like

you

have

attended

an

examination

and

you

sat

and

passed

the

examination"

is

what

I

the

finishing

something"
"I

donâ€™t

think

there

is

any

passing

or

failing

in

this

course.

Or

is

there?

Also

I

believe

everybody

is

going

to

get

the

same

certificate

so

essentially

participation

or

completion

will

only

matter

if

there

are

2

different

certificates

being

issued

to

members

of

the

batch"

understand

the

difference

of

the

words

and

their

definitions.

Would

you

know

the

impact

of

the

with

respect

do

this

course?"
"I

think

the

qualified

part

will

fall

in

place

if

we

focus

on

the

knowledge

retention

part

of

the

course

&

real

life

applications."

professionals

in

this

group

can

answer

it

better...I

think

so."
"Yes

please."
"Yes

everybodyâ€™s

in

the

boat

if

everybody

gets

the

same

certificate."

right,

getting

the

knowledge

is

the

indention.

At

the

same

time,

getting

the

best

deal

for

the

paid

price,

part

of

the

ROI.

Isn't

it

?"
"It

is

not

about

what

everybody

gets.

Here

we

are

not

comparing

each

other.

It

is

about

what

is

then"
"Yes

those

who

have

issues

can

email

them"
"Now

I

am

getting

feel

that

Eruditis

decided

to

ask

declaration

after

we

raising

our

concern.

This

the

reason

Eruditis

is

silent

and

waiting

for

maximum

declarations."
"I

agree

to

the

point

where

certain

companies

only

look

at

institute

you

got

certified/had

a

degree....that's

the

basis

of

the

screening

process"
"Even

if

they

did,

taking

a

may

not

their

cause

in

the

I

am

sure

the

objective

of

this

course

is

not

a

one

time

thing

for

them.

Each

of

us

has

a

view

and

itâ€™s

best

that

eruditis

responds

to

it

sooner

than

later.

Letâ€™s

write

individually

to

them.

If

not

we

will

ask

IiT

and

eruditis

to

speak

to

us

on

the

same.

The

same

messages

on

this

group

being

repetitive

also

is

not

great

for

the

learning

agenda.

So

letâ€™s

leave

at

this

for

now

and

regroup

in

a

weeks

time

and

take

over.

Our

professors

and

the

Eruditis

guys

are

also

on

their

group,

I

am

sure

they

have

read

enough"
ðŸ‘Agree
"There

go

this

what

I

am

right

now"
"Hello

everyone.

I

just

want

to

request

everyone

that

please

let's

not

argue.

We

all

should

respect

each

others

opinions

and

should

solve

any

issues

together.

Yes,

if

completion

certificate

is

given

that's

great.

We

all

want

that.

Ofcourse

we

will

try

our

best

to

make

the

management

understand

that.

Meanwhile

everyone

can

share

their

views.

Cause

different

people

think

differently

provided

their

experience

in

So

please

respect

each

and

learn

in

a

&

ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
"Has

everyone

/majority

going

for

this

declaration

submission.

It

is

like

a

paper

eruditus

is

asking

after

we

have

raised

our

voice

to

silently.supress.it

keeping

document

proof

so

that

there

is

no

legal

action

thereafter.

That's

why

they

have

given

minimal

time

to

submit"
"I

dont

want

to

submit

it

as

it

was

not

a

prerequisite

of

course"
"Legally,

eruditus

can't

disqualify

or

hold

one's

course

as

we

have

been

enrolled

and

this

form

comes

after

attending

2

sessions,

so

legally

this

doesn't

qualify

as

disqualification

point

in

"Will

think

twice

again.to

join

any

course

by

eruditus,,no

grudge

against

institution.

But

its

collaboration.of

eruditus

with

Colleges

for

these

courses

as

these

are

specially

designed

for

their

portal

only,

so

management

responsibilities

is

on

them."
"Everything

youâ€™re

saying

is

right,

Rishabh.

This

is

disappointing

and

coercive

to

say

the

least.

I

think

we

can

just

look

forward

to

the

learning

experience

from

IITB

faculty

and

hope

they

take

the

decision

on

the

completion

certificate

soon.

As

for

joining

any

other

course

with

Eruditus

again,

I

think

youâ€™re

right

again

weâ€™ll

surely

think

twice."
"I

think

eruditus

is

losing

credibility.

because

there

is

no

transperency

in

giving

information

about

course

they

are

transparent

in

onething

that

is

payment.Let

us

all

focus

on

course

because

we

all

know

there

is

no

point

on

arguing

on

this

there

is

one

solution

as

a

batchmate

we

should

unite

on

this

matter

and

raise

our

concern

and

hope

for

the

best."
"Yes

,lets

focus

on

learning

and

i

take

my

stand

,

have

given

email

to

eruditus

that

i

will

not

give

this

form

declaration.

Only

if

they

need

can

give

in

email

point

1

of

asking

fees

back."
"And

i

dont

know

why

eruditus

people

joined

this

group,

to

help

issues

or

to

just

defend

their

positions

if

not

favourable

for

them"
"I

am.ready

to

sign

the

form.

If

anyone

has

not

given

submission

they

can

hold,

but

fear

that

today

being

last

day

majority

might

have

given"
ðŸ‘
"The

conversation

in

the

evening

seemed

to

suggest

everyone

was

sending

the

declaration

most

would

have"
"Yeah,,

i

just

didn't

read

it,,

due

to

time

difference

and

was

busy

in

personal

work

today"
"But

taking

a

legal

opinion

might

have

helped.

Eruditus

just

wanted

to

finish

it

in

haste."
"ðŸ˜„

right.

We

can

still

send

that

form

though.

Eruditus

will

protect

its

interests

through

the

declaration

but

IITB

should

be

taking

a

mature

stand

and

not

see

this

as

a

bunch

of

college

students

creating

a

ruckus

but

professionals

putting

forth

a

concern/recommendation

and

the

decision

will

show

the

IITB

brand

in

a

positive

light

and

make

this

certification

more

appealing

if

anything"
"Actually

Eruditus

team

behaving

like

Life

Insurance

company

with

some

hidden

policy

which

marked

as

star.As

a

brand

that

is

not

good

for

eruditus

if

question

arises

in

first

batch

i

think

people

think

100

times

before

taking

any

course

from

them.I

think

as

a

marketer

they

shold

know

mouth

of

words

is

most

powerfull

weapon

in

Digital

world.They

should

help

us

because

one

unhappy

customer

makes

a

difference."
"Eruditus

recently

received

sme.funding

as

its

becoming

growing

edu

tech

company,

Going

by

that

reputation

i

joined

this."
"Absolutely,

add

assessment

if

thatâ€™s

what

it

takes

to

make

it

completion

certificate.

Although

I

doubt

if

Eruditus

has

a

say

in

making

it

completion

or

participation.

If

it

has

then

it

already

sounds

like

a

lost

case"
"Yes,

Eruditus

will

lose

its

credibility

if

this

is

what

it

does.

I

blindly

joined

the

course

by

seeing

IITB

and

Eruditus

names.

It

is

very

disappointing

to

experience

this.

Nothing

stops

them

from

taking

a

test

and

giving

us

an

assessment

to

issue

a

completion

certificate.

Hope

they

will

do

something

favourable"
"but

if

100

people

facing

such

issues

after

investing

so

much

in

course

and

not

getting

which

should

normally

no

funding

and

promotion

can

save

brand

image.They

also

know

after

completion

if

we

are

not

satisfied

,this

will

affect

eruditus

as

brand.I

still

hope

eruditus

will

try

its

best

to

do

what

is

possible

instead

of

making

excuses

like

a

5th

class

student

giving

to

his

teacher

on

taking

leave

without

any

valid

reason."
"Its

ironic

actually.

I

was

reading

Marketing

4.0

today

and

found

myself

shaking

my

head

midway

not

knowing

whether

to

laugh

or

be

upset

ðŸ™‚

as

everything

Philip

Kotler

was

saying

about

marketing

in

todayâ€™s

age

was

about

making

the

consumer

the

advocate

of

your

brand

and

how

advertising

and

other

traditional

mediums

donâ€™t

work

today

and

its

the

community

conversations,

what

people

say

through

word

of

mouth

that

determines

the

success

of

a

brand.

And

here

weâ€™re

seeing

a

unique

example

of

brand

evangelists

being

prepared

in

this

manner

..."
"I

think

may

be

the

focus

was

100x1L...

that

is

the

reason

the

Eruditus

representative

didnt

mention

other

major

points

on

the

course

when

they

were

calling

and

following

up

with

us

to

join

the

course....

it

was

marketing

but

with

only

1

focus..."
"It

is

a

shame

that

no

eruditus

representative

has

any

accountability

to

address

this

and

has

not

spoken

a

word

about

it.

At

the

time

of

application

they

were

calling

twice

a

day.

Really

a

shame

and

sham."
"I

haven't

"Me

too"
"Me

too"
"Me

neither"
"The

thing

they

should

have

mentioned

it

very

clearly

highlighting

this

point

that

it

would

just

be

a

participation

certificate.

Yeah

I

know

the

certificate

was

available

but

no

one

really

took

a

good

look

at

that

which

led

to

a

lot

of

expectations

and

hence

the

disappointment.

I

hope

they

will

solve

this

issue

in

a

very

professional

manner.

Cause

there

are

too

many

digital

marketing

courses

are

being

offered

for

I

chose

IIT

for

it

All,

In

we

got

a

that

we

should

to

this

was

the

reason

we

did

allow

to

speak

today.

At

that

point

in

we

had

no

idea

what

type

will

be

asked.

So

now

we

have

a

fairly

good

idea

&

we

will

regulate

Please

be

rest

assured

that

we

will

take

care

of

QnA

in

I

agree.

Going

forward

we

should

have

limited

QnA

and

only

have

questions

pertinent

to

the

topic

being

taught

otherwise

it

is

unfair

to

other

batchmates

will

want

to

move

on

than

listen

on

a

response

meant

for

one

"Having

Q&A

is

good,

but

regulating

is

more

important.

Audio

questions

which

are

not

relevant

can

be

passed

on

for

answering

later.

Our

faculty

was

nice

enough

today

to

answer

out

topic

Q's

it

may

lead

to

lost

interest

right.

I

we

should

be

good

there"

think

both

equally

It

is

not

practically

possible

questions

"Prof.

The

general

feeling

is

that

there

are

doubts

that

people

have

as

the

course

goes

along

and

they

canâ€™t

be

cleared

right

there

and

then

due

to

lack

of

verbal

participation.

There

is

a

lot

of

learning

which

happens

for

everyone

when

verbal

doubts

are

cleared."
"Prof.

Today

I

had

questions

which

could

only

be

discussed.

I

raised

my

hand

2

times,

but

I

wasn't

given

the

opportunity

to

ask

the

question.

Not

every

question

gets

answered

with

one

answer,

sometimes

u

r

required

to

ask

a

next

question

as

well.

It's

to

get

more

clarity.

Not

everyone

is

familiar

with

the

jargons.

Sometimes

the

whole

sessions

is

finished

and

you

feel

what

did

I

learn.

It's

not

that

your

teaching

is

bad,

but

people

like

me

who

come

from

pure

sales

background

will

take

time

to

cope

up

and

for

that

we

need

to

know

why,

what,

how,

why

not

of

questions."

one

solving

"It's

clearly

mentioned

that

the

duration

is

for

In

case

the

content

is

covered

months,

still

we

can

should

studies

forms

learning

and

made

do

in

But

the

course

at

any

cost

can't

be

ended

by

Feb

6th.

I

have

joined

other

online

classes

as

well.

That's

how

it

works.

They

focus

on

making

sure

that

the

concepts

are

understood

clearly

through

evaluation

and

practice.

As

we

were

muted

eternally

for

4

months

or

whatsoever.

The

weren't

interactive

at

Now

we

can

at

do

that

in

time

which

is

practising

all

the

concepts.

I

hope

even

teachers

who

delivered

the

lectures

would

understand

what

kind

of

pain

we

are

going

through

for

not

able

to

get

value

for

our

money.

I

think

you

were

all

students

at

some

point

and

also

your

kids.

Just

think

and

see,

how

hard

it's

for

someone

who

came

here

with

a

lot

of

hopes

for

learning

and

changing

their

careers

etc..

at

the

cost

of

lot

of

money

during

the

Covid

crisis,

pay

cuts

and

all.

Considering

all

this,

today's

discussion

should

happen

between

and

Eruditus

and

take

a

decision

will

give

us

some

sense

of

satisfaction

for

joining

this

put

together

ðŸ‘

This

is

a

disgrace

to

an

esteemed

international

brand.

way

avg

content

delivery,

failing

to

meet

promises

and

self

all

we

experienced

all

along."
"True,

I

heard

someone

write

that

he

had

spent

all

his

savings

for

this

course.

That

too

in

COVID

times!!

This

is

the

time

when

people

are

being

supportive

of

each

other

but

what

this

has

turned

out

to

be

is

money

making

engine"
"Yes.

I

agree.

What

is

very

sad

is

that

we

donot

get

any

access

to

the

course

material

to

revise

or

refer

to

after

the

completion

of

the

program.

I

find

it

very

difficult

to

revise

by

the

next

class

,

considering

my

work

schedules."
"To

my

surprise....

i

wonder

how

a

premier

Institution

who

has

a

world

image

of

best

in

education

standards....

has

given

control

to

an

agency

and

"Dear.

All

instead

here,

"I

would

humbly

request

everyone

to

wait

till

the

time

our

discussion

is

completed

with

IITB

.

As

we

mentioned

your

concerns

will

be

addressed.

Till

that

time

I

would

request

your

patience

in

this

matter."
"You

can

keep

on

discussing.

But

be

clear

that

it

is

not

our

concern.

It

is

your

concern

that

you

didn't

gave

proper

thought

to

plan

on

course

schedule

before

it's

start.

It

is

first

batch

for

IITB,

but

for

Euriditis

it

is

day

in

day

out

job......"
"I

have

no

words

to

express

my

disappointment

here.....

What

was

marketed

was

not

delivered"
"But

what

ended

up

is

a

lot

of

theory

with

no

access

to

the

videos

post

completion"
"Yes

I

remember

that

conversation..."
"1

lac

is

not

a

joke

that

too

with

pay

cuts

and

covid....

The

reason

to

do

this

course

was

to

have

change

of

industry...

But

I

guys

it

will

take

lot

more

than

just

a

course

of

6

months"
"There

is

really

no

pressing

need

to

provide

limited

time

access

to

recorded

sessions.

Its

not

just

the

lack

of

time

but

some

concepts

need

to

be

revisited

for

better

learning

retention.

Sincerely

hope

access

can

be

provided

for

longer."
"My

suggestion

is

that

if

at

all

IITB

decides

to

continue

for

another

3

or

4

weeks,

they

should

be

teaching

us

how

to

createe

your

own

website

hassle

free.

I

remember

somebody

was

struggling

to

create

website

last

month

in

this

group.

In

overall

course

I

have

realised

that

one

need

to

have

their

own

website

to

practice

all

concepts

taught

in

class."
"Everyone

of

us

here

has

immense

patience

and

now

it

is

nearing

the

end

of

course

.The

issues

still

remain

unresolved"
"It

is

better

to

utilise

remaining

time

instead

of

wasting

it

to

have

revision

on

topics

which

is

of

no

use

without

practical

experience"
"I

agree

on

the

practical

experience

side

of

things.

3

hour

classes

are

long

and

if

we

even

get

4

6

sessions

of

practical

hands

on

experience

such

as

live

simulations

of

running

fb

and

google

campaigns

and

then

discussing

their

results

in

the

next

class

or

going

through

data

to

understand

it

and

draw

insights

is

going

to

be

a

lot

more

helpful.

Honestly

for

me

the

classes

became

uninteresting

as

there

was

information

overload

without

interaction

and

time

to

absorb

the

content."
"At

this

point

I

am

just

waiting

for

the

classes

to

be

over

so

that

I

can

just

get

my

certificate

and

move

on.

It

is

not

like

having

2

3

more

classes

are

going

to

make

any

content

is

"Can

anyone

share

their

experience

is

it

advisable

to

have

one

agency

for

website

creation/management

and

digital

work

or

both

can

be

managed

separately"
"One

agency"
"Always

works

better"
"Being

on

agency

side,

i

would

say

hiring

specialist

agencies

much

better.."
"You

should

decide

on

basis

of

what

which

agency

does

best."
"Iâ€™ve

come

across

agencies

who

do

amazing

marketing,

but

their

web

dev

team

is

just

sort

of

a

sidelined

part."
"I

agree

with

you.

strategy

and

tech

are

specialized

jobs,

just

dont

compromise

because

you

want

to

work

with

a

single

agency.

They

will

give

you

client

servicing

managers

who

have

one

or

two

years

of

experience

and

they

can

really

screw

your

campaigns.

So

even

when

you

feel

you

have

the

right

agency

make

sure

you

interview

people

who

are

going

to

manage

your

work."
"I

use

a

guy

who

is

specialises

in

website

making,

while

for

digital

work

I

use

other

agency"
"Strategy

comes

first.

It

should

come

from

independent

consultant

or

agency.

this

should

include

messaging,

measurement

framework

for

website/app

and

technical

architecture."
"Most

importantly,

don't

let

an

aspiring

digital

marketer

learn

things

at

your

expenses.

I

had

seen

people

spending

Lacs

of

rupees

and

hardly

getting

any

leads.

Make

sure

you

monitor

your

Google,

Iinkedin

and

Facebook

spent

on

daily

basis.

Also

have

team

of

telecallers

ready

to

chase

leads.

It

will

be

great

if

you

call

the

lead

on

the

same

day."
"Agree

to

this"
"So

I

don't

know

the

product

and

th

company

you

would

be

representing,

but

usually

the

strategy

is

in

place

and

the

objectives

are

pre

defined

internally

after

that

you

brief

the

agencies

and

take

a

quote,

credentials

and

strategy

presentation.

The

quote

has

budget

layed

out

by

elements,

pick

and

chose.

If

the

website

part

is

expensive,

give

that

to

a

cheaper

guy

with

expertise

in

just

website

building"
"Hi

All,

I

just

wanted

to

update

that

I

am

on

leave

until

28th

Jan.

In

case

if

I

miss

on

reading

any

query

or

call,

I

request

you

to

please

connect

on

programme

support

or

get

in

touch

with

Mayur.

Thank

you"
"Thank

you

all

for

your

feedback.

One

important

toss

up

is

between

specialization

and

convenience.

Going

with

multiple

agencies

reduces

the

convenience

but

might

lead

to

higher

core

competencies.

Another

question

which

arises

is

involvement

of

an

agency

with

regards

to

strategy

or

do

we

restrict

them

primarily

for

execution.

One

school

of

thought

says

that

strategy

best

should

lie

with

the

client.

Guess

there

will

be

best

cases

for

all

scenarios."
